Codes for unconstrained submodular minimization. Contains implementation of two algorithms MMin-I, II and MMin-III (See details of the algorithms in Section 5.1 of the paper 'Fast Semi-differential based Submodular function optimization'. 

The main algorithm files are mmin12.m (for MMin-I and II) and mmin3.m (MMin-III). 

The script file simulations.m contains a sample experimental setups for unconstrained submodular minimization to play around with.

For running the codes, you will need to download the matlab toolbox sfo, written by Andreas Krause (obtainable here - http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~krausea/sfo/), and add it to the matlab path.
